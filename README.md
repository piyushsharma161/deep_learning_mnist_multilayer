# deep_learning_mnist_multilayer
## Handwritten Digit Recognition using Multi layers Neural Networks in Python with Tensorflow
I have used 2 hidden layers in the model.
For input and hidden layner1 i have used RELU as activation function 
and for hidden layer2 i.e. last layer i have used sofmax as activation function and finally cross_entropy as loss/cost function.
L2 regulaaization is alos used to Penalize to weight as more layers and more neurons in the the layers may leed to overfitting.
Model gave accuracy of 98% for the Mnist dataset.
